              <h3>About Me</h3>
                  <p>
                   Hi! I am Sebastian, a Senior at <a href="https://www.sandiego.edu/" target="_blank">University of San Diego</a> majoring in Computer Science. I am originally from New Jersey but fair weather and substantial sun has lead me to call San Diego home for the last three years. 
                    For this past academic year I have been fortunate to be interning at <a href="https://www.navwar.navy.mil/" target="_blank">NIWC</a>
                      where I have been able to blend my theoretical knowledge gained from classes with practical applications at work.
                  </p>
                      This Summer 2024, I will continue my work with NIWC as a Software Engineer Intern working on devoloping spatial computing software applications to be utulized by organizations around the country. 
                        I currently assist in development utulizing Microsoft Azure and Unity in C# to facilitate asynchronous communications between Internet of things devices.
                  <p>
                    Outside of work I am an avid runner, pickleball player and camper. I enjoy collecting pins from national parks I have visited and road tripping to various natural wonders California has to offer!
                   </p>

              <h3>Comp305 Car Dealership Co.</h3>
               <h5>Motivation</h5>
              <p>
              The motivation behind our project stems from a school assignment, which offered an opportunity to delve deeper into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and apply them to create practical software solutions.
                We decided to emulate the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, leveraging prior group experience, to build the project from scratch and enhance our understanding of this widely used architectural framework. 
                By developing a car dealership system, we aimed to create an application that could be utulized by businesses today.
              </p>
              <h5>Functional Requirements</h5>
              <p>
              Our project is a comprehensive simulation of a car dealership system, designed to help businesses or individuals manage vehicle transactions effectively. 
                Each day, the dealership begins by printing a list of available carsâ€”a routine task seamlessly integrated into our program. 
                The backend system uses CSV files to load an initial inventory of vehicles, creating vehicle objects to populate the repository. 
                The system monitors each vehicle's availability status, ensuring accurate and efficient management.
              </p>
              <p>
                The program features two modes: guest and admin. In guest mode, users can browse available cars, apply filters, or search for specific vehicles by license plate. 
                 Users can view detailed information about each vehicle, make decisions, and confirm purchases through a straightforward, intuitive interface. 
                In admin mode, admins can access details on all cars, track sales status, and view daily revenue, facilitating informed management decisions and efficient operation of the dealership.
              </p>
            <h5>Project Design</h5>
            <p>
              The design of our project is built around the MVC design pattern, chosen for its clear separation of concerns, which aligns well with our educational goals. 
              We wrote the program in Python, allowing for Python's wide range of libraries. We implemented a functional graphical user interface (GUI) using PySimpleGUI, which simplified the development process.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also integrated the state design pattern to manage the application's flow, enhancing our project's structure and scalability. 
                This pattern helped us organize our code better and facilitated smooth transitions between different states of the application, such as switching from guest to admin mode.
              /p>
              <h5>Implementation</h5>
                <p>
                I was responsible for the business logic in the program that allowed for data analytics of the days transactions. A user would be authenticated with uisername and password then granted access to the interface chosen.
                  Whenever a car was sold which was a functionality only available in the guest state; the revenue was agregated and displayed by the Admin interface.
                  Having a quick and digestible view of the day's transaction assists the user in future projections and allow for a quick insight into the day's success. 
                  When a vehicle was sold the avaibility flag for that vehicle was toggled and updated in the car repository. 
                  This sufficienlty transformed the car repository into a psuedo ledger that tracked what cars had been sold that day.
                  This car repository would be initally created from a csv file that would be first validated to prevent errors on program start up. 
                  Handling of authorization and authentication is an important part of many softwares today so we knew we wanted this implemenation in our program as well.
